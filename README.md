# üëã Welcome to My GitHub Pages!



## About Me

Hello! I'm **Pedram Torabian**, a passionate researcher and data scientist with a strong background in bioinformatics, genomics, and machine learning. Currently pursuing a **Master of Medical Science** at the **University of Calgary**, I leverage my expertise in R, Python, and high-performance computing to analyze complex biological data. My work focuses on spatial transcriptomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and deploying machine learning techniques to uncover insights in cancer research and other genetic disorders.

## üå± My Journey

From the early days of my academic career, I immersed myself in the fascinating realms of genetics and molecular biology. Earning my **Master of Human Genetics** from Iran University, I delved deep into genetic disorders, population genetics, and advanced topics in human genetics. This foundation paved the way for my pursuit of a **Master of Medical Science** at the **University of Calgary**, where I honed my skills in bioinformatics and applied genomics.

Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with esteemed institutions like the **Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute** and the **Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)**. At the Cancer Institute, I spearheaded projects that integrated machine learning with spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing data, developing classifiers that predict cell identities with remarkable accuracy. My role at Amii involved creating educational content for AI applications in biology, bridging the gap between complex scientific concepts and accessible learning materials.
