## 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Pages!

### About Me

Hello! I am **Pedram Torabian**, a passionate researcher and data scientist with a strong background in bioinformatics, genomics, machine learning, and health data science. I leverage my expertise in R, Python, bash, and high-performance computing to analyze complex biological and epidemiological data. My work spans spatial transcriptomics, single-cell RNA sequencing, and patient-level disease modeling using statistical and computational tools. Recently, I have also worked on HTA-focused literature reviews and epidemiological modeling for rare diseases in a CRO setting.

## 🌱 My Journey
My scientific journey began as a wet lab researcher, where I earned my **Master of Human Genetics** with expertise in genetic engineering, population genetics, and biostatistics. This foundation in experimental biology proved invaluable as I advanced to the **Medical Science Program-Cancer Biology Specialization** at the **University of Calgary**, where I pioneered research in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor microenvironment.

At the **Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute**, we were among the first researchers to implement spatial transcriptomics (Nature Method of the Year, 2020) in PDAC studies using Visium 10X Genomics technology. This groundbreaking work required mastery of both experimental techniques and advanced computational methods, including single-cell RNA-seq analysis, bulk RNA-seq, protein-protein interaction mapping, and computational functional assessment through ssGSEA.

My unique strength lies in bridging wet and dry lab expertise, allowing me to approach biological problems with comprehensive insight. I have successfully applied both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to analyze complex biological datasets. Through leading multiple experimental and computational projects, I have developed strong leadership skills that complement my technical expertise. This dual perspective—combining hands-on laboratory experience with computational proficiency—enables me to drive innovative solutions in modern biological research.

Most recently, I worked as a **Modelling Analyst in Genetic Epidemiology** at **ISMS (Integrated Strategic Market Access Services)** as part of a BioNet-funded internship. In this role, I contributed to real-world projects on rare and ultra-rare diseases, performing targeted literature reviews, patient pool estimation, epidemiological modeling, and working with international HTA documentation to support access strategies for pharmaceutical clients.
