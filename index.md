### About Me

Hello! I'm **Pedram Torabian**, a passionate researcher and data scientist with a strong background in bioinformatics, genomics, and machine learning. Currently pursuing a **Master of Medical Science** at the **University of Calgary**, I leverage my expertise in R, Python, and high-performance computing to analyze complex biological data. My work focuses on spatial transcriptomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and deploying machine learning techniques to uncover insights in cancer research and other genetic disorders.


## üå± My Journey
My scientific journey began as a wet lab researcher, where I earned my **Master of Human Genetics** with expertise in genetic engineering, population genetics, and biostatistics. This foundation in experimental biology proved invaluable as I advanced to the **Medical Science Program with Cancer Biology Specialization** at the **University of Calgary**, where I pioneered research in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor microenvironment.

At the **Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute**, I was among the first researchers to implement spatial transcriptomics (Nature Method of the Year, 2020) in PDAC studies using Visium 10X Genomics technology. This groundbreaking work required mastery of both experimental techniques and advanced computational methods, including single-cell RNA-seq analysis, bulk RNA-seq, protein-protein interaction mapping, and computational functional assessment through ssGSEA.

My unique strength lies in bridging wet and dry lab expertise, allowing me to approach biological problems with comprehensive insight. I've successfully applied both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to analyze complex biological datasets. Through leading multiple experimental and computational projects, I've developed strong leadership skills that complement my technical expertise. This dual perspective - combining hands-on laboratory experience with computational proficiency - enables me to drive innovative solutions in modern biological research.
